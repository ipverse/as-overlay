# Autonomous System Metadata Overlay

Community-maintained metadata for autonomous systems with missing or incorrect WHOIS data.

## What is this?

Sometimes AS are announcing prefixes but have:
- No WHOIS records
- Missing country codes in WHOIS
- Incorrect inferred metadata

This overlay fills those gaps and is automatically imported into [ipverse](https://github.com/ipverse).

## How it works

When WHOIS data is missing, ipverse uses inference to discover metadata automatically. When that inference is wrong or incomplete, this overlay provides corrections. Once authoritative WHOIS records appear, overlay entries are typically removed

## Missing data

Two files list AS with incomplete data:

- `missing-metadata.json` - AS with no metadata
- `missing-countries.json` - AS with missing country codes

These files are auto-generated by ipverse. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to use them.
